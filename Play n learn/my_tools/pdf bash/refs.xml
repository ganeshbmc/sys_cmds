      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Since the last decade of the 19th century with the invention
of the electrocardiogram (ECG), technology has played a
significant role in cardiovascular medicine. The extensive use of
technology in the clinical setting, coupled with the early adoption
of guideline-directed-medical-therapy (GDMT) aimed at better
patient outcomes, has prepared the specialty for the promising era
of artificial intelligence (AI) and, more specifically, machine
learning (ML).</p>
      <p>
        In everyday clinical practice, the diagnosis and treatment of
cardiovascular disease (CVD) relies on data in several formats. These
formats include patient history, physical examination, laboratory
data, non-invasive imaging diagnostics and invasive angiography.
The introduction of newer data-rich technologies, including
mobile telemetry devices, wearable and implantable recording
devices, biometrics from the electronic health record (EHR), and
research and other patient-generated health data, requires
cardiologists to perform an increasingly sophisticated analysis [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1 ref2 ref3 ref4 ref5">1–5</xref>
        ].
Bonderman suggests that data and historical evidence may not be the
only factors that influence the clinical decision-making process [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>
        ].
Further, inclusion of social bias and the prejudice of irrelevant
factors characterized by Kahnerman et al. are also incorporated by
clinicians [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>
        ].
      </p>
      <p>Cardiovascular medicine, like other specialties, has faced
pressure to achieve the triple aim: optimize patient care, reduce costs,
and improve outcomes. The sheer volume of data required for this
level of precise care is voluminous and changes too quickly to be
used effectively without the help of a robust clinical decision
support tool. Krittanawong et al. suggest that, without cognitive
computing, our specialty faces practical challenges due to
overutiliza</p>
      <p>Technology pervades our everyday lives, and there is no doubt
that the future of healthcare is intimately intertwined with
technological advancements. Although AI has existed for over five
decades, only recently have we begun to truly realize the
potential of its applications, in the form of ML, in medicine. This
potential holds the promise of better patient care across all healthcare
institutions by augmenting the work of clinicians.</p>
      <p>
        The terms AI, ML, and deep learning (DL) are often used
interchangeably but are essentially hierarchical. ML methods provide a
set of tools to achieve AI and includes supervised, unsupervised
and reinforcement learning [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10 ref9">9,10</xref>
        ].
      </p>
      <p>AI is the overarching concept that refers to the use of
specialized mathematical algorithms, which give machines the ability to
perform problem solving functions, word or object recognition, and
decision making. This rapidly applicable technique deals with
complex problems by analyzing data using neural networks in an effort
to mimic intelligent human behavior.</p>
      <p>
        A subfield of AI, ML encompasses various techniques for
solving complicated problems with big data by identifying interaction
patterns among variables. It uses software that allows computers
to learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1 ref10 ref6 ref9">1,6,9,10</xref>
        ].
In contrast to traditional statistics, one of the applications of ML is
building automated clinical decision systems (such as readmission
and mortality score systems) that help doctors make more accurate

predictions, rather than simple estimated score systems. The ML
community, which has seen increased computational power amidst
the availability of big data, sees an opportunity in the healthcare
sector to tackle complex tasks [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>
        ]. As noted above, ML can be
categorized into three learning types: supervised; unsupervised; and
reinforcement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Supervised learning, which has the widest applicability to date,
is an ML approach wherein a model is given both inputs and the
corresponding ‘correct’ responses during the training [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>
        ]. It deals
with classification and regression problems, and is used to develop
a model for classifying future events or to find which variables
are most relevant to the outcome. Although supervised learning
benefits from having a clearly delineated relationship between the
inputs and outputs, incorrect data labels may result in a less
effective model, since the correct input-output link is determined
entirely by the training data. AI has the ability to lessen social
bias and noise, but is subject to bias when given a biased training
set.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unsupervised learning is a type of ML algorithm used to draw
inferences from datasets consisting of input data without labeled
responses [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>
        ]. The most common unsupervised learning method
is cluster analysis, which is used for exploratory data analysis to
find hidden patterns or grouping in data, data mining for sequence
and pattern mining in medical imaging for image segmentation.
Unsupervised learning seeks to identify novel disease mechanisms,
genotypes, or phenotypes from hidden patterns present in the
data; the objective is to find the hidden patterns in the data
without feedback from humans.
      </p>
      <p>
        In reinforcement learning, the model learns from trial and error
and rewards via a feedback system [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>
        ]. This particular method has
been used in selecting the optimal medication regimen for
nonsmall cell lung cancer [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>
        ]. Reinforcement learning can be viewed
as a hybrid of supervised and unsupervised learning; the
objective of reinforcement learning is to maximize the accuracy of
algorithms using trial and error [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>
        ].
      </p>
      <p>
        A subset of ML is DL. DL attempts to imitate the workings of the
human brain in processing data and creating patterns for use in
decision making. It is inspired by the complex workings of the
human brain and strives to find high-level abstract representations of
a given data set. DL has enabled many practical applications of ML
and, by extension, the overall field of AI. This method has emerged
because of advances in computer processor power and the
availability of big data [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>
        ]. It uses multiple layers of artificial
neuronal networks that can generate automated predictions from
input (training datasets). Benefits of this method over traditional ML
include less data for training and ease of scale with more accuracy
[
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>
        ]. DL can be very powerful in image recognition and can
potentially be used in cardiovascular imaging (e.g., 2D-speckle-tracking
echocardiography, 3D-speckle-tracking echocardiography,
angiography, cardiac magnetic resonance). It can also be trained in an
unsupervised manner for unsupervised learning tasks (e.g., novel
drugdrug interaction). It also works well with noisy data, such as
3Dspeckle tracking echocardiography and strain imaging data. DL
algorithms can facilitate the use of artificial real-time cardiovascular
imaging with better spatial and temporal resolution [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>
        ].
      </p>
      <p>
        Deep learning, as it is primarily used, is essentially a
statistical technique for classifying patterns, based on sample data, using
neural networks with multiple layers. Although DL is useful in
certain tasks such as classifying medical images, DL is not suitable
for all clinical data issues. Kingsbury and coworkers noted that “In
our experience across several clinical problems, conventional, off
the shelf ML methods can be trained faster and have overall better
performance when compared to deep neural networks” [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>
        ].
However, the use of DL in every application that requires data analysis
should not be done at the expense of other ML algorithms with
less computation and memory requirements, which are capable of
producing similar results. Despite the variety of recent successes
of deep learning, there are limitations in the application of the
technique. First, deep learning is not the optimal machine
learning technique for all data analysis problems. For problems in which
data are well structured or optimal features are well-defined, other
simpler machine learning methods such as logistic regression,
support vector machines, and random forests are typically easier to
apply and more effective [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>
        ].
      </p>
      <p>
        Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of deep
neural networks, most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery.
It has been postulated by Dilsizian and Siegel that CNNs are best
optimized to the task of image pattern recognition or image
analysis [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>
        ]. CNNs require little preprocessing and often use the raw
images fed to them, making them a particularly powerful and
versatile tool [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>
        ].The use of CNNs in this manner has increased
drastically over the last several years, with researchers finding success
in the use of CNNs to provide subtle features that a clinician may
miss on a scan, aiding in the detection of a variety of
pathologies. Abdolmanafi et al., for example, utilized a deep-learning CNN
in the classification of coronary artery optical coherence
tomography (OCT) images in patients with Kawasaki disease. However, they
noted in order to fine tune the process, a considerable amount of
time is required [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>
        ]. Additionally, imaging data can be particularly
difficult to manage, especially given the wide array of different
format types in which different imaging modalities are stored, such as
JPEG and DICOM.

      <title>Cognitive computing</title>
      <p>
        The term cognitive computing (CC) is used to describe AI
systems that can synthesize data from various information sources,
weighing context and conflicting evidence to suggest possible
answers. In general, cognitive computing is used to assist humans
in their decision-making process. A number of AI technologies
are required for a computer system to build cognitive models,
including machine learning, deep learning, neural networks, natural
language processing (NLP) and sentiment analysis [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>
        ].IBM Watson
is a well-known example of cognitive computing; it continuously
learns from datasets and can help predict outcomes using multiple
algorithms. CC is currently used at Memorial Sloan Kettering and
MD Anderson, where it uses unstructured data, best practice data,
and clinical study results to help make diagnosis and treatment
decisions for patients [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>
        ].One example of this use in cardiology was
illustrated by Dr. Partho Sengupta, who developed an associative
memory classifier, a cognitive computing machine learning
algorithmic approach, to differentiate constrictive pericarditis from
restrictive cardiomyopathy, and demonstrated its feasibility for
automated interpretation of speckle-tracking echocardiography data
[
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>
        ].
      </p>
      <sec id="sec-3-1">
        <title>Natural language processing (NLP)</title>
        <p>
          NLP is an example of machine learning systems with the ability
to understand and interpret human speech and writing. They
interface with subjective data used in electronic health records (EHRs)
in order to extract useful information that can be used in algorithm
generation. These algorithms can be used to carry out high-volume
tasks formerly accomplished by physicians. A large amount of data
are presented to the cognitive system in order to increase precision
of decision making. Ng et al. have described guidelines that
recommend the types and amount of data needed to effectively use
disease prediction models using EHR data [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>
          ]. Sohn et al.
demonstrated the feasibility of NLP in processing radiology reports and
developed a model for identifying aneurysms [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>
          ]. Since NLPs can
scan multiple databases, libraries and other data sources, they are
useful in identifying critical valvular and vascular stenosis,
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, atrial septal defects, and other anomalies
[
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22 ref23">22,23</xref>
          ].
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2018, Garvin et al. demonstrated the use of a novel NLP in
collecting and classifying clinical data from more than 1000
patients with heart failure in order to determine the quality of
inpatient care given [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>
          ]. Although this technology is still in its nascent
stages, the potential to accurately and effectively utilize the vast
stores of clinical data included in EHRs and leverage this
information to assess present quality of care is a promising method in
directing future improvements.
        </p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-3-2">
        <title>Applications of ML</title>
        <p>The potential of ML, DL and CC to change the manner in which
cardiac data is utilized –their accuracy, objectivity, and efficiency
– is undeniable. With the development of increasingly
powerful machines and as DL approaches gain traction, the
diagnostic fields of radiology (computed tomography [CT], magnetic
resonance imaging [MRI] and mammography interpretation), pathology
(microscopic and cytological diagnoses), dermatology (rash
identification and pigmented lesion evaluation for potential melanoma),
and ophthalmology (retinal vessel examination to predict the risk
for diabetic retinopathy and cardiovascular disease) can be further
advanced in the interest of elevating patient care.</p>
        <p>
          The potential applications of ML in medicine are numerous and
represent various ranges of computational difficulty. The use of
extracted data in the generation of algorithms to apply to a given
problem is the most common application of ML in healthcare.
The utility of such ML algorithms has already been established in
numerous settings. For example, automated ML-driven algorithms
have been helpful in the classification and early diagnosis of
micromelanomas, the implications of which are reduced mortality and
less intensive treatment requirements [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>
          ]. The efficacy of
MLdeveloped algorithms heavily depends on the availability of data
to build these predictive frameworks. In cardiology, these data sets
can come from a variety of modalities. Data-rich sources include
electrocardiograms (EKGs), echocardiograms and other myocardial
imaging modalities; ‘omics’ technologies including genomics and
proteomics that can aid AI in the profiling of particular molecular
entities and help risk-stratify patients; and information recorded
by clinicians in the EHR. However, not all data sets share equal
potential in their applicability to AI systems. The data collected from
EHRs is often subjective in nature and thus difficult for accurate AI
utilization, therefore making NLP useful [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>
          ].
        </p>
        <p>
          The efficacy of ML in the analysis of predefined tasks, such as
image processing for border detection on a scan or recognizing
suspicious areas on an image, is a crucial aspect of ML’s utility in
healthcare. Enhancing the process of visual pattern recognition has
profound implications on the process of clinical diagnostics. It is
important to understand the shortcomings of human visual pattern
recognition. Two independent studies have found that 50–63% of
U.S. women who receive regular mammograms over ten years will
receive at least one false positive; additionally, one third of the
time, two or more radiologists examining the same mammogram
will disagree on the interpretation [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>
          ]. Analyzing images and
performing diagnostic prediction tasks, for example, using ML to
detect diabetic retinopathy, are harder than the simple
aforementioned tasks but still possible with the present technology [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>
          ]. In
this setting, visual pattern recognition software, which can store
and compare tens of thousands of images while using the same
heuristic techniques as humans, is estimated to be 5% to 10% more
accurate than the average clinician [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>
          ]. So far, ML has exhibited
demonstrable value in the analysis of different myocardial imaging
modalities, from EKGs to MRI, and in utilizing that information to
establish probabilistic frameworks whereby they may establish the
presence or lack of disease in a given image.
        </p>
        <p>
          AI, especially ML, has impacted healthcare in four
overarching ways [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>
          ]. One is through computer vision. Computer vision
is a field of AI that trains computers to process, analyze,
interpret and understand digital images. Using digital images from
photographs, videos and DL models, machines can accurately
identify and classify objects. Applying this feature to medical images,
computer vision can support disease detection and clinical
decisions regarding classification for staging and prognosis. The second
and third are predictive modeling and precision medicine-guided
care recommendations. Predictive modeling is used for assessing
genetic risk (genomics) and for predicting the course of chronic
disease (phenomapping). This approach requires multiple datasets
coupled with natural learning processing and machine learning.
Precision medicine looks at an individual’s health data (EHR data,
wearable data), and omics data (i.e., genomics, proteomics, and
metabolomics) and uses cluster analysis and other ML analytics
to make individualized recommendations. The last way is a health
system performance enhancer, which uses ML analytics to gain
insights into healthcare system management and improve clinical
care and patient safety.
        </p>
        <p>Uncertainty is a fact of everyday medical practice, with
complex variables and determinants that govern a patient’s health and
create diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas. This uncertainty can
be addressed by AI, specifically ML, as it augments the abilities of
clinicians by helping them provide the highest standard of care.
This aspect has the potential to create uniform medical care from
different health-care providers.</p>
        <p>
          AI offers the ability to further standardize the quality of care
by working with clinicians by providing all the necessary and
pertinent information and making predictions required to make the
optimal diagnosis and the best plan of care for follow-up. For
example, Hannun et al. demonstrate the efficacy of DL in the
classification of various EKG rhythms, a powerful addition to every
cardiologist’s diagnostic toolkit [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>
          ]. AI performs the analysis of
data from clinical notes, allowing clinicians to meet documentation
standards while integrating societal, clinical, and personal context
into the decision-making process. The use of AI in this regard may
help standardize quality of care by helping to reduce two major
elements of decision-making error: social bias and noise, factors that
may affect a physician’s judgment, such as mood, for example [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>
          ].
It is impossible to completely eliminate human biases, but using
AI can significantly reduce such errors. Ultimately, the optimal role
of ML will be to support clinicians, ensuring that the final
decision regarding diagnosis and treatment falls on the clinician; it is
hoped that the analysis and augmentation of information with ML
will help ensure optimal clinical decisions.
        </p>
        <p>Hospitals are also scrutinizing ML tools to increase capacities
without expanding building space, improve clinician
productivity without adding to work hours, and minimize patient
waittimes while increasing the number of incoming patients. A
growing number of medical centers are considering a new,
innovative form of digital management called hospital command centers.
These centers use advanced predictive analytic technology and ML
to monitor and analyze real-time data on patient admissions,
patient discharges, bed availability, and other hospital logistics to
address their unique needs and strategic functions. As a result
of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, health care organizations and
providers have had to deal with increases in patient volumes and
regulations with new documentation standards. This development
has led to clinician burnout, a factor that makes the achievement
of the quality goal of the quadruple aim impossible. As health
organizations grapple with this issue, it is hoped that the hospital
command centers may help simplify administrative burdens and
optimize the practice of patient-centered care.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-3-3">
        <title>Limitations of ML in medical practice</title>
        <p>While putting the power of ML to work in clinical settings
presents a variety of exciting applications, as mentioned above, this
endeavor is not without several crucial limitations. The algorithms
developed by machine learning technologies are only as effective
as the data used to frame them. There is a wide variety of sources
from which important patient health information could be drawn
–certainly cardiac parameters, such as heart rate, rhythm, etc. –
much of which could be used by ML systems in the development
of valuable analytic algorithms. Conversely, the lack of such data
and large amounts of poor-quality data compromises the integrity
of this process; the use of sparse or biased data sets could
result in problematic algorithms that do not accurately represent the
clinical situation in question. Additionally, many valuable sources
of information, such as EHR data, as well as information
regarding social, cultural and economic determinants, may be difficult to
find or implement. Training issues also limit the success of ML. The
models used also may change over time, requiring frequent
updating. The algorithm may additionally become over tailored to the
training sample rather than finding the relationships in the data.</p>
        <p>
          Although ML – and AI in general – has become considerably
more advanced in recent years, the technology is still in its early
stages compared to many other, more established, modalities. This
reality poses potential complications for its integration into
medical practice. The application of ML into medicine may be costly,
discouraging its widespread utilization. Although it is reasonable to
assume that ML has the potential to revolutionize physician
workflow in many positive ways, the initial implementation of these
technologies may prove jarring for providers as they struggle to
adjust day-to-day routine. According to Cucolo et al., the ‘black box”
nature of the ML algorithm and the difficulty for clinicians to
understand and trust the interpretation of the data may be the most
difficult hurdle to overcome [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>

      <title>Applications in cardiology</title>
      <p>Technology has been a mainstay in the field of cardiology for
the past several decades, with successful integration into
diagnostics and intervention. The efficacy of utilizing AI and specifically
ML in cardiology has also been established in a variety of different
settings, such as coronary artery disease with risk prediction, and
cardiac imaging, including electrocardiography and
echocardiography.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-5">
      <title>Cardiac imaging and imaging interpretation</title>
      <p>Cardiac imaging is an area that shows early promise. DL
systems such as CNNs have shown great potential as valuable tools
in cardiac imaging. Many authors have published results
highlighting the use of CNN and other methods for coronary calcium
detection, thrombus volume characterization, left atrium segmentation,
coronary stenosis, carotid artery characterization, detection of and
classification of aortic aneurysm, and others.</p>
      <p>
        Diagnostic support for cardiac imaging uses segmentation of
known anatomical landmarks. In this application, the model is
trained using deep reinforcement learning to quickly navigate
through the volume of CT images to find and localize the
anatomical landmarks [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>
        ]. Once the landmarks are identified, AI-powered
segmentation methods can be used to quantify the structures.
This application may be useful for modeling and segmentation of
heart valves and, more specifically, for sizing implants. Its use may
also facilitate the switching from real-time x-ray to 3D CT in the
catheterization laboratory [

      </p>
      <p>
        ML can have a positive impact on imaging reconstruction,
analysis and interpretation. Its ability to analyze large amounts of
imaging data and then couple with the use of dedicated imaging
software can allow imaged displays to show more anatomic views,
allowing for ease of image interpretation [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>
        ]. Du et al. tested DL
technology for angiographic recognition of lesion characteristics,
including diameter stenosis, calcification, thrombus and dissection
[
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>
        ].Work done with DL to automate calcium scoring in patients
following Rb-PET/CT showed good correlation for the classification
with five categories, from very low to very high calcium scores
[
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>

coronary artery disease more accurately compared to conventional
methods using myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) [

        Ciusdel et al. trained a deep neural network on 17,800

      <title>Electrocardiography</title>
      <p>
        Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is at the core of
cardiovascular pathology diagnosis. Since 1996, when it was first described,
the use of AI for electrocardiography continues to be refined [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>
        ].
ECG analysis is the most developed application of machine
learning methods in cardiology, owing mostly to publically available
databases for training and testing such as the MIT-BIH, Physionet’s
Physiobank, INCART, or the American Heart Association database
[
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref>
        ]. The open access to ECG databases has led to the
development of many methods and approaches for computer-aided ECG
arrhythmia classification over the last decades.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ECG reflects the electrical activity of the heart, and for a
normal beat in sinus rhythm includes the P wave, the QRS
complex, and the T wave. Heartbeat classification focuses on the
automatic identification of normal beats and abnormal beats, and can
be useful for detecting ectopic beats or arrhythmic events.
Modern ML models can identify QRS complexes and P and T waves
with high precision, thus allowing for calculations of clinically
significant parameters such as HR [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>
        ]. The use of DL systems has
improved the analytic power of EKGs; indeed, DL has been
successful in accurately classifying the EKGs of cardiac patients into
normal, abnormal, and life-threatening states [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>
        ].DL techniques
to help automate the detection of atrial fibrillation (AFib) are
occurring with EKGs and ambulatory EKG systems [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>
        ]. The
Stanford Machine Learning Group used a form of DL, a 34-layer
convolutional neural network to detect a range of arrhythmias which
outperformed a board-certified cardiologist in recall and precision
[
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>
        ].ML is being rapidly implemented into wearable devices
operating deep neural network (DNN) in ECG analysis. Kannathal et al.
used a deep neural network to classify ECG signals of cardiac
patients into normal, abnormal, and life-threatening states, and found
the classification to be correct in approximately 99% of test cases
[
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>
        ].
      </p>
      <p>
        Wearable devices for ECG monitoring are having an impact
on the effort to move the clinic to the home. The Apple Watch
and AliveCor are well known examples of such devices [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref>
        ]. In
the case of Alive-Cor, the wearable technology is integrated in a
smart phone application and records ECG data from patients. These
data are analyzed with a machine learning algorithm to help
detect atrial fibrillation or other arrhythmias. Machine learning
techniques provide accurate and automatic classifications of heartbeats
to detect arrhythmias or unexpected changes in heart
morphology. They may help in automatic disease diagnosis, monitoring and
stratification by handling extended ECG recordings for which
visual and manual inspections can be tedious and time consuming.
Their real-time use, along with their adaptability to be embedded
on wearable devices, can help with efficient and reliable
monitoring of ECG activity at home.

      <title>Echocardiograms</title>
      <p>
        Much work has also been done in the integration of ML
systems in the analysis of echocardiography. In 2016, Sengupta
and colleagues utilized a cognitive computing system to
distinguish between constrictive pericarditis and restrictive
cardiomyopathy, while also demonstrating its efficacy in the interpretation
of speckle-tracking echocardiography data [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>
        ].
      </p>
      <p>Echocardiograms are an important tool in the diagnosis and
management of cardiovascular disease. ML has the potential to
change the landscape of echocardiography with its complimentary
tools that can help generate accurate, consistent and automated
interpretation of echocardiograms, thus potentially reducing the risk
of human error, as interpretations are presently done by clinician
expertise. Automation with longitudinal strain and 3D
echocardiography has shown great accuracy and reproducibility, allowing the
incorporation of these techniques into daily workflow. These
attributes can help decrease inter-operator variability and give
experience to non-expert readers.</p>
      <p>
        Research calls to mind the feasibility of applying ML
models to provide rapid, highly accurate and consistent assessment
of echocardiograms, comparable to the ability of clinicians.
Algorithms are capable of accurately quantifying a wide range of
features, such as the severity of valvular heart disease or the
ischemic burden in patients with coronary artery disease. There is at
least one innovative software solution, developed by Edwards
LifeSciences, that focuses on improving the quality of patient care and
growing structural heart programs [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>
        ]. Artificial intelligence is
the driving force behind its core capability of assessing diagnostic
echocardiogram quality, following patients through the care
pathway, and helping physicians and their clinical staff ensure their
patients are receiving guideline directed care.
      </p>
      <p>
        A recent study of over 14,000 echocardiograms showed promise
for AI applications to automatically classify image orientation,
perform image segmentation and assign a diagnosis [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>
        ]. Detection
of wall motion abnormalities on echocardiography requires
experience and can thus suffer from observer variability. AI solutions
are emerging, which have good accuracy for this task [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35 ref37">35,37</xref>
        ].
      </p>
      <p>ML in electrocardiography is routinely used in patient care, as
opposed to ML in echocardiography, which is still in its infancy.
Work such as that being undertaken utilizing Edward’s software
will further this field.</p>

      <title>Clinical decision support</title>
      <p>
        Clinical decision support systems with cognitive computing are
being developed and use ML, pattern recognition, and NLP. In
coronary artery disease (CAD), the capacity of ML systems to develop
algorithms capable of making clinical predictions was
demonstrated by Baxt in 1991, in which an artificial neural network was
trained on more than 300 patients who were hospitalized with
suspicion of myocardial Infarction (MI). Upon subsequent testing of
new patients presenting to the Emergency Department with chest
pain, the computer-derived protocol had a higher sensitivity in
detecting MI compared to that of the clinicians caring for these
patients [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>
        ]. In a pilot study published in 2018, an ML algorithm
showed 94% accuracy for predicting a myocardial infarction in
patients presenting with chest pain in the emergency department
[
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>
        ].
      </p>
      <p>
        More recently, the Francis Crick Institute developed a model,
using ML, which was found to be better at predicting risk of death
in patients with heart disease than in models designed by
medical experts. The model for coronary artery disease was designed
using the electronic health data of over 80,000 patients, collected
as part of routine care by scientists at the Crick, working
collaboratively with colleagues at the Farr Institute of Health Informatics
Research and University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation
Trust. They outperformed experts using self-taught ML techniques
[
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>
        ]. It should be noted here that, although this result may be
statistically significant (C-index for AI algorithm 0.801 vs C-index
for conventional risk prediction for death in CVD patients 0.793),
it may not be clinically significant at this level of difference. This
study illustrates an important issue of the difference between
statistical vs. clinical significance. Whereas statistical significance
indicates reliability of study results, clinical significance reflects its
impact on clinical practice. Statistical significance testing has
established traditionally accepted values, which is lacking for
evaluation of clinical significance. Statistical significance is largely
dependent on the study’s sample size; in large sample sizes, even small
treatment effects, which maybe clinically non-significant can
appear statistically significant. Thus, it is important to interpret
carefully whether statistically significance is clinically meaningful [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>
        ].
      </p>
      <p>
        Recently, Dawes et al. developed an algorithm of
threedimensional systolic cardiac motion based on MRI; this algorithm
allowed the researchers to more accurately predict survival rates
of patients with newly diagnosed pulmonary hypertension [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref>
        ]. In
general, AI technologies are being utilized for CAD risk prediction,
including machine, and coronary calcium scoring algorithms to
make predictions regarding patient risk. Importantly, the
machinelearning approach can address the limitations of conventional risk
scores by taking into consideration multiple risk factors,
determining the relationship between these factors and outcomes.
Conventional prediction models take into account standard risk factors
such as age, cholesterol levels and blood pressure but do not
account for factors like medications, other medical conditions and
non-traditional biomarkers [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>
        ].
      </p>
      <p>
        ML algorithms are based on fewer assumptions and can, in
some cases, provide superior and more robust predictions [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>
        ]. For
example, Azzalini et al. used generalized boosted regression (an
ML approach) to identify whether contrast media type was an
independent predictor of contrast-induced acute kidney injury after
percutaneous coronary intervention [

        A clinical decision support system studied for interpretation
and treatment of stable coronary artery disease is CEREBRIA-1
(Machine Learning vs Expert Human Opinion to Determine
Physiologically Optimized Coronary Revascularization Strategies). In this
study, an ML algorithm for analysis of 1008 instantaneous
wavefree ratio pullback tracings were evaluated and compared with the
analysis of a team of interventionalists, and it found that the ML
program was non-inferior to the interventionalist for PCI decision
making [

      <title>Precision cardiac medicine</title>
      <p>
        Aside from imaging, assessment of CAD and interventional
cardiology, AI has shown promise in the area of precision cardiac
medicine. Giri et al. state in their paper, “To date, big data, such
as ‘omics’ data, are too large and heterogeneous to be stored,
analyzed, and used to their full potential”[
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>
        ]. AI techniques may solve
this issue as well as allow for automatic generation of new
hypotheses, instead of requiring that physicians postulate them [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>
        ].
Unsupervised DL may facilitate exploration of novel factors in score
systems and better prediction analysis, or add hidden risk factors
to existing models [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1 ref8">8,1</xref>
        ]. This approach could lead to new models
for antiplatelet/anticoagulant therapy, bleeding versus stroke risk,
mortality risk with procedures, as examples [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>
        ]. ML-based
techniques also can highlight long-term outcomes or late complications
for patients who have undergone a specific procedure or are
prescribed a specific drug.

this approach could be used more extensively in the future to

cardiovascular disorders that could benefit from AI-driven

      <title>Data sources: uses and limitations</title>
      <p>Clinical cardiology offers an overabundance of different sources
of data for use by AI in the formation of algorithms. This
information includes phenotypic data, such as EKGs and other myocardial
imaging modalities, many of which provide narrow data sets that
are optimally suited for machine learning. What is especially
interesting and exciting in the field of cardiology is the use of
datarich technology, such as implantable recording devices, or even
everyday technology such as smart phones and smart watches that
keep track of cardiac parameters like heart rate and are able to
record tracings of an EKG. These technologies then present the
potential for direct-to-patient applications of cardiology. The
acquisition of these large and diverse datasets and patient-generated
data streams from new wearable and implantable sensor
technologies can provide a very granular view of the intra- and
interindividual variations in health and disease. Making full use of these
multidimensional data streams will require the computational and
data analytic ability of ML to process these data meaningfully and
rapidly.</p>
      <p>
        Presently, clinicians often do not have time to review all of
this information derived from these sources, since this task
involves combing through numerous pages of a single patient’s
device data. ML has the potential to provide processed summaries of
these data, which would be most useful in guiding therapy. As the
connected self generates all kinds of data, for example, heart rates
and ambient arrhythmias, we need to understand what is normal.
For example, if someone has a run of atrial fibrillation, a
technology has to first classify this event correctly, and then there has to
be an evidence standard that can influence the clinical care. This
issue of what is the right evidence standard for AI was discussed
at length by Maddox et al.; they argued that an evidence
standard is required to demonstrate outcomes and a lack of unintended
consequences [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>
        ].Further, the need of machine learning to utilize
data-rich pools in order to develop effective algorithms necessarily
precludes them from being helpful in analyses of rare disorders for
which we simply do not have enough data to train machine
learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is predicted that soon, health care organizations and
providers will embrace algorithmic solutions on smart phones or
tablets first, followed by pattern recognition software and, finally,
machine-generated best practices for individual patients [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4 ref6">4,6</xref>
        ].
Patients will be able to use a variety of AI tools to care for
themselves, just as they manage multiple other aspects of their lives
today through ubiquitous usage of AI systems like Apple’s Siri or
Amazon’s Alexa [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>
        ].
      </p>
      <p>Those most excited about AI technology wonder whether AI
could autonomously detect warning signs of disease or acute
incidents through fine-tuned predictive algorithms and send that
information directly to patients. Such an application may not only
save lives, but also aid in managing patient behavior through
active tracking of parameters such as weight, blood pressure, and
activity level, and help warn patients. How the integration of AI can
modify these behaviors is not known. It is important to note that
presently this technology is designed to aid a clinician’s decision
making rather than be used by the patient directly for their
healthcare management. Despite the efficacy that ML has exhibited in
terms of forming predictive models by utilizing presently available
data, an important dimension that is often missing from these
predictions is the timeline. Although an algorithm may suggest that a
patient is at higher risk for developing a myocardial infarction, it
cannot define an accurate timeline of the event because presently
available datasets do not adequately define such timelines. In spite
of this issue, AI may continue to be useful in helping clinicians to
make risk predictions.</p>

    <sec id="sec-11">
      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>
        AI and ML systems have initiated a paradigm shift in health
care. Clearly, these systems are useful in the identification of
clinically significant patterns in high volumes of heterogeneous data –
be it from smart watches, EHRs or ECGs – even if the importance
of these patterns is not causative, but rather purely correlational
[
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>
        ]. EHRs were not originally designed to predict disease risk or
offer treatment options to consider. But when combined with ML,
EHR data could potentially do both, transforming health care in the
process [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26 ref47 ref6">47,6,26</xref>
        ].
      </p>
      <p>
        In the day-to-day practice of cardiology, AI, specifically ML, is
expanding its footprint, presently most suited to a spectrum of
computational tasks with a range of difficulties, the best of which
are narrow tasks, such as image processing, in which the system
is working with a predefined context. Even tasks of pattern
prediction and broad data analysis are conceivable today, if these
endeavors are specifically asked for. In other words, the systems are
not self-directed and require appropriate data sets. Therefore, the
role of ML in cardiology is most likely to remain supportive for
the foreseeable future, augmenting cardiologists with relevant
information and predictions regarding diagnosis and best treatment
but leaving the ultimate decision in the hands of the clinician. For
AI, ML integration comes with the need for appropriate evidence
standards; there is a lack of standardization across datasets,
making optimal models for clinical integration challenging. According
to a recent work by Maddox et al., developing task-appropriate
standards, as well as an elucidation of the manner by which ML
develop their predictive insights beyond the idea of a “black box”
methodology, may prove helpful in assuaging some of the concerns
that clinicians may have in integrating ML into their practice [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>
        ].
      </p>
      <p>
        History has shown us that the forward progress of
technological advancement is unlikely to slow down; medical technology is
no exception. The forward momentum of AI and ML technology
has demonstrated that the technology will not replace clinicians
but will augment their care delivery. Ultimately, it is the
clinician who has the capacity to demonstrate empathy, compassion,
and complex reasoning under uncertain conditions, traits that
patients want in their medical care. Indeed, ML could be the very
thing that catapults American healthcare into the future, helping
to clarify the best care approaches, creating new approaches for
diagnosing and treating hundreds of complex medical problems,
and measuring adherence. This outcome will not happen overnight,
of course; recall that efforts to produce self-driving vehicles date
back to the 1950s. There are certainly many challenges that remain
ahead: Who will regulate this industry? Who will objectively
assess the effectiveness of this new technology? Who will be held
accountable for errors? These are questions being asked about
autonomous driving technology today [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>
        ]. But sometime in the
future, ML will disrupt healthcare as we know it.
      </p>
      <p>In preparation for that day, health care providers need to
actively engage to adapt their practice and to shape the technology.
Rather than fearing that the ML technology will displace them,
they should direct and craft the technology for end users. The
anguish of the clinician’s EHR experience drives the importance of
creating the type of change that is needed and wanted. The
favorable adoption of AI in the form of ML into medical practice can
be further facilitated by its integration into medical school
curricula. This feature will help develop future clinicians who are not
only effective, empathetic healthcare providers, but who are also
accomplished in the utilization of AI systems in their practice in
a manner that improves diagnosis, care, and outcomes. AI,
specifically ML, is guaranteed to be more closely intertwined with our
lives, and the field of cardiology would do well to embrace this
trend and the potential it presents.</p>
